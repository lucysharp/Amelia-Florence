<h5>Amelia (Florence) Radcliffe is a self-taught artist who is currently studying Business with Strategic Economics at the university of Edinburgh. 
However her creativity and love of art began at a young age. She started her career in fine art after receiving much attention from her GCSE and A-Level pieces. 
After this Amelia realised the sales potential of her work started completing commissions for friends and family.</h5>

<h5>Amelia then undertook a partnership with 'The Vintage Tack Room' in West Sussex which broadened her business as well as giving her national recognition.</h5> 

<h5>Amelia submitted a 'Scottish' collection of drawings and paintings to be included in an exhibition held at The Dundas Street Gallery in Edinburgh, which raised money for Maggie's Cancer Care.</h5> 

<h5>Amelia has now diversified into producing prints and greetings cards of her work, which she also sells on request.</h5>
